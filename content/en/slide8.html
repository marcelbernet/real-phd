<h2>Slides 8 & 9: Bars and Spiral Arms</h2>
<p>
    Our galaxy isn't just a blob. It has structure! The two most important are:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Galactic Bar:</strong> A huge, cigar-shaped traffic jam of stars in the center. It spins like a baton thrown by a majorette, forcing stars all around it to move in weird ways.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Spiral Arms:</strong> You know these! They're like giant waves of star formation. As Marcel's slide says, "anything you put there will basically create a spiral... This is a problem xD". My job is to figure out if our spirals are caused by the bar, or by something else entirely.
