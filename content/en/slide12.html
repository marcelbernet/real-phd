<h2>Slides 12: Breaking the Deadlock (or Trying to)</h2>
<p>
Alright, we've seen these maps full of "lumps" and structures. The key takeaway is that if our galaxy were perfectly quiet and nothing had ever happened to it, these maps would be completely smooth and boring. Every lump, every swirl, is a clue. It's a scar that tells us a piece of the Milky Way's history.

In this section, I focused on the gap that appears between the two large colored blobs. Where does it come from? Well, here's where the trouble begins: we have several suspects. One possible explanation relies on the galaxy's central bar spinning very fast, while a completely different one works if the bar spins more slowly.

This is a constant headache in our field, which we technically call <strong>"degeneracy,"</strong> but you could translate it as "confusion" or "ambiguity." It's the situation where two totally different causes (A and B) can produce a nearly identical result (C). Our job as detectives is to analyze C in such detail that we can figure out if the culprit was A or B.

So, how do we break this deadlock? The idea I explore next is that, until now, we were only looking in our neighborhood, around the Sun. But if we zoom out and map these lumps across the entire galactic disk, maybe we'll see how they change, and that will give us the definitive clue.

The conclusion, and I know it might be a bit <strong>anticlimactic</strong>, is that neither model A nor model B fully works when we look at the large-scale data. The reality is more complex. To make up for it, here are images of the most important lumps: <strong>Hercules, Sirius, the hat, and the horn.</strong>
