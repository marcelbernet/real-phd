<h2>Slide 20: The Verdict: Simple Static Models Don't Work</h2>
<p>
Armed with this new tool (the gradient-painted skeleton), we tested the classic fast and slow bar models. The result was unequivocal.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Both models failed spectacularly.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Although they could roughly reproduce the position of the main structures (the skeleton), they were completely unable to reproduce the gradients (the "colors"). The discrepancy was enormous, with a statistical tension of more than 3-sigma. In physics, this is very strong evidence that the model is wrong.
</p>
<p>
The conclusion of my second article is, therefore, that simple models of a galactic bar rotating at a constant speed <strong>are incorrect</strong>. The real physics must be more complex. One possibility, which is now gaining traction in the community, is that the bar is not rotating at a constant speed, but is <strong>slowing down</strong> over time.
