<h2>Slide 77: SINDy, or How a Midnight YouTube Video Can Change Your Thesis</h2>
<p>
Okay, we needed a new approach. And I found it in the most unexpected way possible.
</p>
<p>
SINDy is an algorithm that, to me, is basically magic. You feed it data from a complex simulation, without knowing the underlying physics, and the code returns the actual <strong>mathematical equations</strong> that govern the system. It's like something out of a fantasy.

<strong>The true story:</strong> Summer of 2021. I still didn't even know if I'd get the grant to do my PhD. One night, around midnight, wasting time on YouTube, I stumbled upon a video of a guy from Seattle (I thought he was from Washington) named Steven Brunton. He was explaining how they had created this code. It sounded so incredible that I decided right then and there: "I want to use this someday."

<p>
It took me almost four years to find the perfect project to apply it to (convincing Teresa and Pau was easy, finding the "what" was the hard part). In the end, I had meetings with Professor Brunton, and he even became a co-author on the paper. For me, it was like collaborating with a famous YouTuber. I was absolutely thrilled.
