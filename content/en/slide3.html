<h2>Slide 3: Anatomy of the Galaxy</h2>
<p>
To understand what we study, first we need to know what our galaxy is like. The best analogy is to think of a <strong>pizza</strong>: it's a very wide but extremely thin disk.
</p>
<p>
It's about 80,000-100,000 light-years from edge to edge, but only about 2,000 light-years thick. That's why when we look at the night sky and see that band full of stars (the "Milky Way"), what we're actually doing is looking sideways through the "dough" of the pizza from our position inside it.
</p>
<p>
The main parts are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Disk:</strong> The flat part of the pizza, where we are and where most of the young stars, the bar, and the spiral arms are.</li>
<li><strong>The Halo:</strong> A giant, diffuse sphere that surrounds the entire galaxy. It contains very old stars (stellar halo) and, above all, a huge amount of <strong>dark matter</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>The Perturbers:</strong> Mainly Sagittarius and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).</li>
</ul>
