<h2>Slide 10: The Goal</h2>
<p>
    So, here it is. The entire goal of my PhD, summarized:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>"Understand the dynamical mechanisms (the rocks) that have shaped the Milky Way disc in recent times."</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In normal people language: "Find out what has been crashing into our galaxy and messing up the orbits of our stars."
</p>
<p>
    Let the detective work begin!
