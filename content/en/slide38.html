<h2>Slide 38: The Circle Closes</h2>
<p>
Alright. We have new equations that describe complex spirals. Now what?
</p>
<p>
Well, now we return to the original question, the one we asked a while ago: <strong>are there signs of an interaction in the real data of the Milky Way?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Now, however, we have a new weapon. We are no longer just looking for "things that look like a spiral." Now we can look at the Gaia data and ask: "does this structure we see behave according to the new equations we have found?".
</p>
<p>
On the slide, I show a very specific projection of the Gaia data where a very characteristic blue curve is visible. The final question of the thesis is: can we use our formulas to explain why the stars in our galaxy draw this peculiar shape?
</p>
<p>
This is where everything connects.
</p>
<p>
On the left, the observational data from Gaia. On the right, the predictions of our models, based on the equations that SINDy helped us find.
</p>
<p>
What we do on this slide is, literally, superimpose one thing on top of the other and see if they match. It is the definitive test to see if this whole mathematical and computational adventure has a reflection in the reality of our galaxy.
