<h2>Slide 6: Gaia, our Galactic Google Maps</h2>
<p>
Gaia is, without exaggeration, the mission that has revolutionized our field. It's our "Google Maps" of the Milky Way. It has provided an unprecedented 3D map of over a billion stars, telling us where they are and, most importantly, how they are moving.

A little jab at my PhD colleagues: in the end, one way or another, Gaia data ends up appearing in almost all the research at the institute, even in projects that seem completely unrelated. It's just that powerful.

<strong>Personal note:</strong> The background image on this slide is not a photo. It's data. It's a visualization of the table of numbers that Gaia produces. The first time I saw it was in Lisbon, during my Erasmus exchange, and it blew my mind so much that it's one of the main reasons I decided to pursue astronomy and, specifically, to work with this data. I'm thrilled to have it here today.
