<h2>Slide 93: The (Real) Conclusions</h2>
<p>
I've already gone over the technical conclusions. Now for the real ones.
</p>
<p>
The main conclusion is that I had a blast. This has been a really fun thesis, I've thoroughly enjoyed these years of research, I've learned an incredible amount, and I've been lucky enough to work with fantastic people.
</p>
<p>
I think the thesis came together really nicely, and I'm very happy with the result.
</p>
<p>
And most importantly, thank you all so much for coming, for listening to me ramble, and for your support. Now, if you're up for it, let's go have a picnic to celebrate.
