<h2>Slide 4: The Bar, the Spoon in the Galactic Coffee</h2>
<p>
The central bar is the most significant structure we know for certain exists in the Milky Way. But be careful, it's not a solid beam! It's made of millions of stars following elongated orbits that, all together, create this bar shape.
</p>
<p>
And this is where the thesis starts to get a bit <strong>trippy</strong>. This bar isn't static: it rotates at a more or less constant speed. Imagine the galaxy is a cup of coffee. The rotating bar is like a <strong>spoon stirring everything up</strong>.
</p>
<p>
This gravitational "stirring" causes waves and disturbances throughout the entire disk, even very far from the center, where we are. It affects the orbits of stars, mixes them up, and creates many of the structures we see in the Gaia data.
</p>
<p>
The key mechanism behind this is <strong>resonance</strong>. It happens when the frequency at which a star orbits the galaxy couples with the rotation speed of the bar. This synchronization allows for a very efficient exchange of energy and momentum, which can trap stars in specific orbits or scatter them, creating the "lumps" we observe.
</p>
<p>
The first part of my thesis is precisely about studying the effects of this "spoon" on the stars in our neighborhood to try to deduce, indirectly, the characteristics of the bar (how fast it rotates, how big it is, etc.).
