<h2>Slides 4 & 5: My Secret Weapon, Gaia</h2>
<p>
    This little satellite is the hero of my thesis. It's called <strong>Gaia</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Its job is to create the most insane 3D map of the galaxy ever. It has measured the precise positions and velocities of over <strong>1.4 BILLION</strong> stars.
</p>
<p>
    Before Gaia, studying the galaxy was like trying to draw a map of Europe from a rowboat in the middle of the Atlantic. Now, it's like we have a GPS for almost every star. It's truly amazing!
