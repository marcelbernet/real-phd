<h2>Slide 2: Gaia - Our Galactic GPS</h2>
<p>
The first pillar of this work is the extraordinary data from the Gaia mission.
</p>
<p>
Gaia is an all-sky survey mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). It is measuring the positions, distances, and motions of stars with unprecedented precision. For this thesis, the key is that it provides 6D data (3 position coordinates and 3 velocity components) for over 33 million stars in our galactic neighborhood.

I have been a member of the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) since 2019, which has given me a front-row seat to this incredible data stream.
</p>
<p>
The most important insight from Gaia is that it has shown us that our galactic disk is far from being in a quiet, stable state (or "in equilibrium"). Instead, it is full of complex structuresâ€”streams, arches, and ripples of stars moving together. This is the direct result of the gravitational "rocks" disturbing our cosmic river.
