<h2>Slides 2 & 3: The Metaphor</h2>
<p>
    Okay, what's with the rock in the water?
</p>
<p>
    This is the whole thesis in one picture:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <strong>flowing water</strong> is our galaxy, the Milky Way, with all its stars moving together.</li>
    <li>The <strong>rock</strong> is a disturbance â€“ maybe another smaller galaxy that crashed into ours, or a weird clump of invisible matter.</li>
    <li>The <strong>magnifying glass</strong> is the Gaia satellite, the tool I use to study the ripples (the stellar motions) caused by the rock.</li>
</ul>
<p>My entire PhD has been about studying these ripples to find the rocks.</p>
