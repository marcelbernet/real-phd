<h2>Slide 2: Welcome to the Backstage</h2>
<p>
Hi! If you made it here, it means the QR code worked. Welcome to the "backstage" of my thesis.
</p>
<p>
This little website is an experiment. The idea is to give you extra content, anecdotes, and more "street-level" explanations of what I'm covering in the formal slides. Think of it as a director's commentary for a movie.
</p>
<p>
<strong>How does it work?</strong> Very simple: from time to time, I'll reveal a <strong>keyword</strong> during the presentation. Just type it into the main text box and hit "Unlock." New links with fun facts will appear.
</p>
<p>
Don't worry, everything is cumulative. You won't miss a thing! Now, pay attention to the presentation again, as I'm starting the introduction. I'll give you the first code to unlock it in a bit!
