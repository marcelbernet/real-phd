<h2>Slide 14: My Method: The Phase-Space Skeleton (Article 1)</h2>
<p>
Until now, the analysis of these "lumps" was done by eye, in a subjective manner. This was a huge limitation. The motivation for my first article was: can we automate this? Can we create a tool that finds these structures objectively and reproducibly?
</p>
<p>
The solution came in two parts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Wavelets:</strong> A mathematical tool that acts like a filter to detect peaks and valleys in the data. I used it to robustly identify the position of the main "bones" of our velocity map.</li>
    <li><strong>Graph Theory (BFS):</strong> Once you have the bones, you have to assemble the skeleton. I used a graph theory algorithm to connect the detected groups at different distances from the Sun, thus creating the first 3D <strong>"phase-space skeleton."</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>
The result is a quantitative and objective representation of the main structures of the galactic disk, which revealed that the groups are more complex than we thought: they merge and split, rather than being simple, isolated structures.
