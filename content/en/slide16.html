<h2>Slides 14-18: Finding the Troublemakers</h2>
<p>
    This colorful plot is one of the most important in Galactic dynamics. Don't worry, it's simpler than it looks.

    Imagine all the stars near us are kids on a giant merry-go-round.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most kids just sit and spin in a circle. That's the big, bright yellow blob in the middle. They are "well-behaved" stars.</li>
    <li>But some kids are running around, either towards the center or away from it. These form weird clumps and streams on the plot. They are the "troublemakers".</li>
</ul>
<p>
    One of the biggest groups of troublemakers is called <strong>Hercules</strong> (yes, like the Disney movie, as pointed out by the image!). For years, we've been trying to figure out what's causing the Hercules stars to move so weirdly.
