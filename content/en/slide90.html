<h2>Slide 90: Coming Full Circle</h2>
<p>
Alright. We have new equations that describe complex spirals. Now what?
</p>
<p>
Well, now we return to the original question, the one we asked a while ago: <strong>are there signs of an interaction in the real data of the Milky Way?</strong>
</p>
<p>
But now, we have a new weapon. We're no longer just looking for "things that look like a spiral." Now we can look at the Gaia data and ask: "does this structure we're seeing behave according to the new equations we've found?".
</p>
<p>
On the slide, I'm showing a very specific projection of the Gaia data where a distinctive blue curve is visible. The final question of this thesis is: can we use our formulas to explain why the stars in our galaxy trace this peculiar shape?
