<h2>Slide 1: The River Metaphor</h2>
<p>
If you didn't quite catch what I explained about the river, no problem! Here it is again, explained more calmly.
</p>
<p>
Imagine a river where the water flows perfectly straight, and all water particles move in the same direction. Now, let's say we have a magical tool that lets us see the velocity of each individual particle. In this perfect river, all the velocity arrows would point forward.
</p>
<p>
Now, let's throw a rock into the middle of the river. What happens? The rock disturbs the flow. A bit downstream, the water no longer moves uniformly. Some particles will go right to avoid the rock, others left, some might create small whirlpools... Their velocities will no longer be identical.
</p>
<p>
The key idea is this: by observing how "messy" the water flow is downstream, we could try to <strong>deduce the shape and size of the rock</strong> that caused the disturbance, without even seeing it directly.
</p>
<p>
Well, in my work, we do exactly that, but on a slightly larger scale:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>water particles</strong> are the <strong>stars</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>river</strong> is our galaxy, the <strong>Milky Way</strong>.</li>
<li>The <strong>rock</strong> (the disturbance) can be anything: the galaxy's central bar, spiral arms, or even another galaxy that collided with ours millions of years ago.</li>
<li>Our <strong>magical tool</strong> for measuring the stars' motion is the <strong>Gaia</strong> satellite.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Basically, my thesis is about looking at <strong>Stellar Motion</strong> to try to figure out what "rocks" are in our galaxy and what story they tell us.
