<h2>Slide 46: Ghost Spirals!</h2>
<p>
    This is one of the coolest results from my work. We all know the Milky Way has beautiful spiral arms made of stars (the middle panel).
</p>
<p>
    But the galaxy is also surrounded by a giant, invisible halo of <strong>Dark Matter</strong>. For a long time, people thought this halo just sat there, like a boring, static blob.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>My simulations show that's wrong!</strong> The gravity of the stellar spiral arms is so strong that it actually drags the dark matter along with it. This creates a faint, invisible set of "ghost spirals" made of dark matter that perfectly mimics the real ones (right panel).
</p>
<p>This means spiral arms are about <strong>10% heavier</strong> than we thought they were!</p>
