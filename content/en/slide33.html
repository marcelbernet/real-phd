<h2>Slide 33: Deceptive Simplicity</h2>
<p>
In this work, we decided to get to the root of the problem. We took the simplest possible model you can imagine for an interaction: a satellite galaxy that flies by very fast and from very far away. Think of it as the textbook case, the most basic one of all.
</p>
<p>
The surprise? Even in this ultra-simplified scenario, the resulting dynamics are chaotic. As you can see in the videos, the spirals that form are geometrically and mathematically very complex. They change shape, speed, they intertwine...
</p>
<p>
This led us to the main goal of this paper: if not even the simplest case behaves as we expected, it means we're missing a fundamental understanding. The goal, therefore, was to find the <strong>mathematical language</strong>, the equations, that govern these seemingly chaotic spirals.
