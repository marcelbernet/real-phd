<h2>Slide 72: The Failed Attempt (Round 1)</h2>
<p>
This problem isn't new to us. In fact, this paper is a sort of "spiritual sequel" to another work we published with Teresa 3 years ago.
</p>
<p>
In that first attempt, we tackled the problem with the tools we had at the time, but to be honest... <strong>we didn't succeed</strong>. We were able to describe a few things, but the complete model eluded us.
</p>
<p>
That paper ended with more questions than answers and left us with a feeling of "there's something more here, but we don't know how to find it." That unresolved issue is what motivated us to search for a radically new approach to, this time, try to solve the puzzle for real.
