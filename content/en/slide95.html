<h2>Slide 95: Where Do We Stand Now?</h2>
<p>
To finish, a final reflection on where we are in our field right now.
</p>
<p>
We are living in a golden age. We have observational data (like Gaia's) and computational simulations of a quality and resolution that were unthinkable just a few years ago. They are so good that, in many ways, <strong>they have surpassed our ability to explain them with "pen-and-paper" theory</strong>, that is, from first mathematical principles.
</p>
<p>
There is a gap between the complexity of the reality we observe and the simplicity of our theoretical models.
</p>
<p>
My thesis, and particularly the use of techniques like SINDy, sits precisely in this intermediate space. It's an attempt to build a <strong>bridge</strong>: using information from complex data and simulations to help theory evolve, to discover the new mathematics we need to understand the Universe.
