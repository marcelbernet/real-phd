<h2>Slide 70: My Secret Weapon 2.0 - SINDy</h2>
<p>
    Okay, this looks complicated, but the idea is super cool. I used a type of Artificial Intelligence called SINDy.
</p>
<p>
    Think of it like a "reverse calculator". Normally, you type `2 + 2` into a calculator and it gives you `4`. With SINDy, you do the opposite:
</p>
<p>
    You feed it tons of data (the `4`), like the positions and velocities of stars from a simulation. Then, the AI tries to guess the simplest mathematical equation (the `2 + 2`) that could have produced that data.
</p>
<p>
    I used it to discover the fundamental equations that describe what happens when another galaxy flies by ours and creates spiral waves. For small fly-bys, it re-discovered a famous 60-year-old equation. But for big, messy fly-bys, it discovered a <strong>brand new equation</strong> that nobody knew before!
