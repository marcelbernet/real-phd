<h2>Slide 7: The Bread and Butter of our Field</h2>
<!-- The image from slide 7 would go here, if you want to include it -->
<p>
These plots you see on the slide might look like a mess of lines and spirals, but for us, they are our daily bread. All these swirls, ridges, and weird structures that Gaia has revealed are the "bread and butter" of our current research field.

<p>
Before Gaia, we thought everything would be much smoother and simpler. Now we know that the Milky Way's disk is full of these structures, which are the scars and wrinkles that tell us its history.

My thesis, in large part, tries to answer the question: <strong>where does all this come from?</strong> What caused the stars to move in this very particular way?
