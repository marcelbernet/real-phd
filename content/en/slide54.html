<h2>Slide 54: Summary of the Second Paper</h2>
<p>
While I go through the technical details of this work, here's a summary of the main ideas so you don't get lost.
</p>
<p>
In this paper, we explored the properties of these "wakes" or "shadows" that the galaxy's spiral arms create in the dark matter halo.
</p>
<p>
The key findings were:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It's not a fluke:</strong> We confirmed that this effect appears in many different simulations with various initial conditions. It's a robust phenomenon.</li>
<li><strong>More arms, more shadow:</strong> We found a direct correlation. The more prominent and numerous the spiral arms in the stellar disk, the stronger and more defined their "ghosts" are in the dark matter halo.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Basically, we laid the groundwork for understanding how these two major components of the galaxy (arms and halo) "talk" to each other through gravity.
