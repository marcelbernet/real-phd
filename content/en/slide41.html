<h2>Slide 41: Final Thoughts & The Real Conclusions</h2>

<p>
To finish, a final reflection on where we are in our field right now.
</p>
<p>
We are living in a golden age. We have observational data (like Gaia's) and computational simulations of a quality and resolution that were unthinkable just a few years ago. They are so good that, in many ways, <strong>they have surpassed our ability to explain them with "pen-and-paper" theory</strong>, that is, from first mathematical principles.
</p>
<p>
There is a gap between the complexity of the reality we observe and the simplicity of our theoretical models.
</p>
<p>
My thesis, and particularly the use of techniques like SINDy, sits precisely in this intermediate space. It's an attempt to build a <strong>bridge</strong>: using information from complex data and simulations to help theory evolve, to discover the new mathematics we need to understand the Universe.

<h2>Now, for the real conclusions</h2>
<p>
The technical conclusions have been explained. Now for the real ones.
</p>
<p>
The main conclusion is that I had a blast. This has been a really fun thesis, I've thoroughly enjoyed these years of research, I've learned an incredible amount, and I've been lucky enough to work with fantastic people.
</p>
<p>
I think the thesis came together really nicely, and I'm very happy with the result.
</p>
<p>
And most importantly, thank you all so much for coming, for putting up with my rambling, and for your support. Now, if you're up for it, let's go have a picnic to celebrate.
