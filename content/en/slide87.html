<h2>Slides 86-87: What Did the Machine Tell Us?</h2>
<p>
After a lot of work adapting and applying SINDy to our problem, we finally got results. We fed it our spiral simulations and waited to see what equations it would discover.
</p>
<p>
And the results were fascinating:
</p>
<ul>
<li>For <strong>small, gentle impacts</strong>, SINDy found some very beautiful, elegant, and simple equations. So perfect, in fact, that some very smart people had already discovered them back in the 1960s. We didn't invent anything new, but we proved that the method works: it rediscovered known physics.</li>
<br>
<li>For <strong>larger, more complex impacts</strong>, the story changes. SINDy found new equations that are not as pretty and much less simple. These equations were previously unknown, and they describe the behavior of spirals in a regime that was, until now, theoretically inaccessible. So yes, we have "discovered" (in quotes) a new set of mathematical tools.</li>
</ul>
