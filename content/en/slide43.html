<h2>And now... the questions!</h2>
<p>
Thank you for your attention! The jury's question time will now begin, which will last approximately one hour. Heads up! Only doctors in the room may ask questions!
</p>
<p>
But first, a hehehe request: traditionally, you don't applaud until after the questions, but I'd prefer you to applaud now, before I know if I've said a lot of nonsense. Thanks! ^^

<h3>Entertainment for the wait</h3>

While the jury deliberates, here are a few suggestions to pass the time:

    <li><a href="#" target="_blank">Kahoot about the defense!</a> (Link will be active soon)</li>
    <li><a href="http://whentaken.com/" target="_blank">whentaken.com</a> - A game to guess where and when a photo was taken.</li>
    <li><a href="https://nonograms-katana.com/" target="_blank">Nonograms Katana</a> - My personal downfall during the preparation of this defense.</li>
    <li><a href="https://slowroads.io/" target="_blank">slowroads.io</a> - A relaxing and enjoyable little thing I found while looking for links for this.</li>
</ul>
